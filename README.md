## Title
The infrastructure for time and kernel profiling for Mimiker operating system

## Abstract
In every fast-growing system like Mimiker, there comes the need to optimize it.  To do so, you need the right tool to measure the system's performance.
I will present the implementation of such a tool for the Mimiker system. Moreover, I will describe the methods of collecting information and examples of profiles.
The work will also introduce the time infrastructure, which is crucial for profilers.
I will also describe the time functionalities which I implemented.
